## Key Patterns

**Grid recurrence**
```
dp[i][j] = f(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
```
Each cell depends only on the cell above and the cell to the left.

**Space optimization**
When `dp[i][j]` only depends on the previous row, replace the full 2D table with two 1D arrays (`prev` and `current`), reducing space from O(m×n) to O(n).
